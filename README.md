# trace-survey
Dash / Plotly survey hosted on Heroku

The survey is pretty much complete, the only issue is that we do not have our entire list of people to send it to yet. We are scraping SSRN for financial researchers who have key words like 'TRACE', 'Fixed Income', etc. As well as sending it to people at the Federal Reserve that my advisor knows.
