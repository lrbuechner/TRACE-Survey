# TRACE Survey 

This is a component of a larger project to create a robust outlier detection algorithm for fixed-income transactions in FINRAS's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). This survey was created to have professional financiers / researchers classify anomalies in time series data in order to have test data upon which to optimize our algorithms paramaters. 

This version of the survey is from it's early stages, prior to connecting to a PostgresSQL database. 

## Comments

Use the selection tools provided on the scatter plot to select multiple points. Without holding shift during your selection, your previous selection will be forgotten. By holding shift and either clicking/lassoing points, you can select multiple points. 

Additionally, the 'Summary' tab displays the state of your information and indicies of your selected points prior to being stored in a database hosted on Heroku. This is just is/was the current state of the project and I thought it would be approptiate to use as the version to post on GitHub. 

Lastly, the data being used is just a subset of the bonds that will be in the live survey.
