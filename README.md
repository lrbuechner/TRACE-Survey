# trace-survey
Dash / Plotly survey hosted on Heroku

The survey is practically complete, the only issue is that we do not have our entire list of people to send it to yet. We are scraping SSRN for financial researchers who's publications have key words like 'TRACE', 'Fixed Income', etc as well as sending it to people at the Federal Reserve. 

The only thing that hasn't been finished is the tutorial page. Additionally, the last Feedback page is only for demo purposes and will be removed when the survey goes live.
