# TRACE Survey 

This is a component of a larger project to create a robust outlier detection algorithm for fixed-income transactions in FINRAS's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). This survey was created to have professional financiers / researchers classify anomalies in time series data in order to have test data upon which to optimize our algorithms paramaters.
